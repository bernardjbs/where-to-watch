[Title](to be added)

# Summary

Here is an application designed to help movie enthusiasts decide which movie to watch and navigate where, and how to watch it, weather it be bought, rented, or streamed. A user can decide amongst a list of titles matching search criteria, check reviews and selected movie, check featured cast and their latest movies, and view information on where the movie is bought, rented, or streamed and where it can be accessed online. 

# Goal

The site was designed to provide users with single place to gather information on a film they are interested in viewing. 

# Further Implementation

* A panel to switch between review websites to compare how different sources to reduce perceived bias. 
* Access to all cast members and a panel to assort their movies based on popularity, date, and/or ratings. 
* A single page dynamic workflow, shifting information based on user selection criteria. 
         


# Installation 

```
git init
git remote add origin main
git branch -M main
